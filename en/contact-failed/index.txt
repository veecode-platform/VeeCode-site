You'll have to learn how to deal and manage the cloud, and are expected to do it spending less money. But there are infinite choices for each resource available: clusters, databases, load balancers, keys, the list goes on and on.</p> <p>We have automated most of this under VKPR - you can skip most of the learning curve and keep your focus on the fun parts. Our tools will take you there through automation, IaC and GitOps.</p>"},"option4":{"title":"A Kubernetes cluster is not enough","description":"<p>Taking things into production in a cloud native mindset requires much more than just a managed cluster. We can help you define your architecture by bringing to your cluster the necessary components that will make them production ready. Yes, you will need components for observability, an API gateway, load balancers, databases and security. And we will support all of them, providing a self-service experience so that clusters are no big deal.</p> <p>What we want is for you not to take months to decide your IT architecture. You can do it today!</p>"},"option5":{"title":"You are not alone","description":"<p>You are not alone We provide support for our code and tools - and they are yours to use forever, even if you are not a customer anymore.

Now with <strong>VKPR</strong> your transition and use of cloud-native tools becomes simpler. We built a command line interface dedicated to build kubernetes clusters in a fast, simple and automated way through IaC pipelines following the GitOps methodology. Along with a helper tool that makes it easy to install and manage applications that are in the cloud-native world, without having any lock-in from use.</p>"},"option7":{"title":"Automate your API building","description":"<p>We know how expensive and time-consuming it is to build an API. To solve this problem, we built a command-line interface, <strong>Safira-Cli</strong>.By using an open API file, along with a simple command, our CLI builds a complete API template in the most used Java frameworks on the market: SpringBoot and Quarkus. All this in a fast and automated way. In addition, our solution allows customizations that bring robustness to the project, such as using Mockserver, pipelining configurations and containerization by Docker and Kubernetes, as well as a high level of security with API gateway like Kong and authenticator like Okta.</p>"},"option8":{"title":"Centralize your Microservices management","description":"<p>The microservices architecture revolutionized the internet, and taking advantage of this innovation we created the DevPortal.
