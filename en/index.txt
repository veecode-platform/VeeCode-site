Our tools are opinionated and will reduce your choices to a reasonable few.

And we will support all of them, providing a self-service experience so that clusters are no big deal.</p> <p>What we want is for you not to take months to decide your IT architecture. You can do it today!</p>"},"option5":{"title":"You are not alone","description":"<p>You are not alone We provide support for our code and tools - and they are yours to use forever, even if you are not a customer anymore.

All this in a fast and automated way.
